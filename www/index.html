        <h1>Wire Racer</h1>
        <p>
            Wire Racer is a 3D racing game with wireframe graphics that I'm working on as my semestral project for VAII.
            All rendering is done using a software rasterizer that runs directly on your machine using WebAssembly.
            The game is not yet finished but most of the work on the rasterizer is already done so launching the game
            shows a demo of a spinning cube.
